# neural-imageresolve
Image resolution enhancer. 

This is an ambitious project in search and exploration of a novel method to enhance the resolution of an image taken from lower quality sources.It may be necessary to use neural computing since improving the resolution might include adding aditional data.

<h2>Classification: Image types</h2>
I hereby arbitrarily classify my set of images into two :
 <h4>1. Common Class</h4>
 <h4>2. Investigatory Class</h4>
