# neural-imageresolve
Image resolution enhancer. 
<h3 color="red">....Currently elaborating the idea( Project coding hasn't started )....</h3>

This is an ambitious project in search and exploration of a novel method to enhance the resolution of an image taken from lower quality sources.It may be necessary to use neural computing since improving the resolution might include adding aditional data.

<h2>Classification: Image types</h2>
I hereby arbitrarily classify my set of images into two :
 <h4>1. Common Class</h4>
        This class of images or pictures will be considered to be the one we casually take on our smart devices.Selphies and such fall into this category.In this project we will concentrate completely on this class.
        They maynot require deepest details of the image.A profile cloning (from local image and the neural net memory) to the deepest will give appearance of higher resolution.The deep-details are not necessary while picture capture because the viewers consider the overall appearance and integrity of the picture. Hence our method would suffice.
 <h4>2. Investigatory Class</h4>
       This class of images require the images to be taken using high resolution picture capturing devices.Our method would fail in the images of this class.Where deep details contain features not common to the other segments of the image and maynot be predictable to any acceptable degree.<i>We ignore this class</i>.
